[0] COPYRIGHT NOTICE
--------------------
WinDEU 5.24 was created by the "DEU team":
Renaud Paquay, Raphael Quinet, Brendon Wyber, Ted Vessenes and others.

[0.1] USAGE
This program is free software.  The latest version can be obtained free of
charge on most Doom-related FTP servers (try ftp.cdrom.com, ftp.idsoftware.com
or ftp2.montefiore.ulg.ac.be) and on the alt.binaries.doom newsgroup (on
Internet/USENET).

[0.2] DISTRIBUTION
You are granted the rights to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
software package (including the three unmodified zip files w16deu524.zip,
w32deu524.zip and wscdeu524.zip), under the following conditions
* You may distribute it free of charge.  If you distribute WinDEU bundled in a
  collection of other programs or files, or with a magazine, book or another
  material, the whole package must be free.
* If you are charging any distribution fee for WinDEU or for the media on 
  which it is distributed, you must meet one of the following two conditions:
  - Your package includes the following notice on the cover or any place
    where the people can look before having to open or buy the package:
    "includes the Doom editor WinDEU 5.24 (free software)".  If your package 
    can be ordered by mail or phone, this notice should also appear in any
    advertisement.
  - You send a free copy of the package in which WinDEU is included or with
    which it is distributed (disk, CD-ROM, magazine, book,...) to at least
    five (5) members of the DEU team.  You are free to choose which members
    of the DEU team will receive a free copy, but please include a list
    of the persons you choose, so that we can check it.

[0.3] MODIFICATIONS
You are allowed to modify and distribute modified versions of this program
(free of charge or not) under the following conditions:
* If at least ten percent (10%) of the code is new, your program must
  display the following notice when executed, or in an "about" window:
  "This is a modified version of the free software package WinDEU 5.24.
   WinDEU was created and is maintained by the DEU team: Renaud Paquay,
   Raphael Quinet, Brendon Wyber, Ted Vessenes and others."
  This notice should also be included as is in the documentation of your
  program, if any.
* If at least fifty percent (50%) of the code is new, you can choose to
  use this shorter notice instead: "This program contains some source code
  from WinDEU 5.24, written by the DEU team."
* If you are using less than ten percent (10%) of the WinDEU source code in
  your program or if you just used the algorithms but not the code directly,
  you are not required to display any credit notice.  But it would be nice and
  courteous to do so.
* If your program contains some code from another version of WinDEU (and/or DEU)
  and you add some code from this version to it, the total counts as "WinDEU source 
  code".
* If requested by a member of the DEU team, you agree to submit your source
  code to a neutral third party who will estimate how much of the code is new.
  Changes in the comments and credit notice will not be counted.
You are not allowed to distribute modifed copies if you do not fulfill these
conditions, although you are allowed to make modifications for your personal
use.  Please consider joining the DEU team: this is the best way to contribute
to the DEU project, and you will be credited for any code (or ideas) included
in the next version.
