Future
======
- WinDEU 5.3: DEU 5.3 port to Windows.

Apr 11 1995
-----------
- Bug fixed in level selection dialog box.
- The scroll lock key now affects only the mouse movements inside the
  editor window (when dragging objects or selecting with box), but the
  map scrolling is always possible with cursor keys and scroll bars.

Apr 10 1995
-----------
- Added enablers for Delete and Copy functions, to disable them
  when no object is selected.
- Added icons in editor toolbar for Delete objets, Copy objects, Add object, 
  Show ToolBar, Show Status Bar, Show Info windows.
- Information windows can be layout horizontaly or verticaly, upper or
  lower, left or right of editor window. See the "Window|Position" menu
  item.
- New dialog box to get level number.
- New dialog box to display level statistics.
- WinDEU is now smarter when editing multiple objects. It remembers what
  the user changed in the dialog box and automaticaly selects the
  corresponding check boxes for the "Copy Confirmation" dialog box.

Apr 09 1995
-----------
- Added icons by CalvHobs1 (DOOM icons) in resource
- Added icons by Noel ??? (Original icons) in resource

Apr 04 1995
-----------
- Fixed weird bug in WinDEU 16-bit version. When loading a level with
  more than 64Kb of SideDefs, SideDef 0 was partialy overwritten by
  SideDef 2184. This bug was due to Windows memory management in 16-bit
  protected mode, this is why WinDEU32 was not affected.

Apr 03 1995
-----------
- Added a progress dialog with cancel button for some operations:
  . checking level
  . building main wad or grouping patch wads.

Apr 02 1995
-----------
- X offset limit set to -32767 to +32767. Thanks to Drake O'brian for telling
  me the bug.
- Logo added in the dialog box. Thanks to CalvnHobs1@aol.com for the 2 
  WinDEU logos.
- Inserting a rectangle/polygon is now a two-phase action:
  . first enter the rect/poly informations
  . then move the mouse and LMB click to "drop" the rect/poly.

Apr 01 1995
-----------
- Hint text is now displayed in the title bar (easier to read)
- Move movements are now ignored when WinDEU window is not active
- Free memory display is updated every 2 seconds in status bar

Mar 31 1995
-----------
- Window size was not restored correctly after rebuilding nodes.
  Bug fixed.
- Size of WAD created calculated correctly when building main wad or
  grouping wads.

Mar 30 1995
-----------
- When zooming with menu items or toolbar button, the zoom is not
  centered on the pointer, but on the screen. When zooming with "+" and
  "-" keys, the zoom is centered on the mouse pointer.
- Fixed bug which made impossible to GROUP WADS or BUILD MAIN WAD when
  using a DOOM2 main wad.

Mar 28 1995
-----------
- WinDEU 5.24 beta 1 release.

Mar 27 1995
-----------
- Objects are now unselected when changing mode with T, V, L and S
  keys, but remains are when using Tab and Shift-Tab (same as DEU 5.21)
- Menu item "Swap LineDefs" changed to "Swap SideDefs"
- GridScale, ShowGrid and SnapToGrid are now in the configuration file
- Help file updated 

Mar 26 1995
-----------
- *NEW FEATURE*
  Added Toolbar in main and editor windows

- *NEW FEATURE*
  Added Undo/Redo functions in editor

- *NEW FEATURE*
  MaxUndo config option, which determines the maximum number of Undo/Redo 
  levels

Mar 13 1995
-----------
- Fixed minor bug when zooming pictures.

Mar 12 1995
-----------
- DOOM2 thing not selected in "edit thing" list box when using WinDEU32.
  Bug fixed.

Mar 10 1995
-----------
- Minor changes in the help file
- Garbage displayed when entering initial offset of X texture alignment.
  Bug Fixed.

Mar 9 1995
----------
- Fixed bug with very small PWAD (only 1 sector): couldn't build nodes.
- Fixed bug in 'Jump to object' dialog box (GPF when closing).
- Fixed bug of finding help file when changing current directory (under NT).

Mar 5 1995
----------
- WinDEU 5.23 PUBLIC FINAL RELEASE
- Copyrights comment modified in each source file
- LICENSE file modified
- Full heretic support (LineDefs)
- Small fixes

Mar 3 1995
----------
- Oups! forgot to include the ctl3dv2 and ctl3d32.dll int zip files.
- WinDEU32 sometimes used to enter infinite loop when editing a Thing.
  I don't really know the reason, but it seems to be fixed with the new 
  full compilation (maybe a bug in BC++ ?).

Mar 2 1995
----------
- WinDEU 5.23 *Final* release

Mar 1 1995
----------
- Help file (at least) finished (pffouuhh;-) (*lot* of work: 580Kb!!!)
- When no picture for a thing or texture, WinDEU display two crossing lines 
  (like DEU) and the entry name.
- In edit Thing dialog box, Player pictures now displayed with DOOM colors
  (GREEN, GRAY, BROWN and RED).

Feb 28 1995
-----------
- Added X and Y position in edit thing dialog box.
- Map wasn't marked as changed when editing sectors, linedefs and things,
  under particular cicumstences.
- Added a dialog box for editing vertices (x and y position).
- When editing a group of LineDefs, WinDEU used to display a warning
  message when trying to copy SideDef data from a LineDef with no
  such SideDef. This was a result of WinDEU policy to copy SideDef
  attributes instead of SideDef number. WinDEU still uses the same
  policy, but with an exception: if the source SideDef number is "-1",
  WinDEU will display a message asking to copy the SideDef number
  instead of the SideDef data.
  This is useful if you want, for example, suppress the second SideDef
  of a group of LineDef. You select the LineDefs, then you set the
  second SideDef number to "-1" in the edit LineDef dialog box,
  then you check the "Second SideDef" check box in the "Confirm copy
  of LineDef attributes" dialog box. WinDEU will put "-1" in each second
  SideDef number of the selected LineDefs.

Feb 27 1995
-----------
- *NEW FEATURE*
  Added the tuturial (TUTOR.DOC) in the help file (section 9).
  Added "Tuturial" menu item in "Help" popup menu (both main and editor
  menus).

- Included the tutorial WAD files in W??DEU52.ZIP
  NOTE: From now on, you *should* unzip W??DEU52.ZIP with -d option.

Feb 26 1995
-----------
- Added minimize button to Level rebuilding progress dialog box.
  Use this button to minimize the WinDEU window when rebuilding a level.
  The icon displays the 3 builders completetion pourcentage, exactly like
  the dialog box.
- Suppressed flickering when viewing picture (Zoom and Gamma correction)
- Added HERETIC things pictures (thanks to DEU 5.3 beta3)
- In the Thing dialog box, changed "Dead bodies" check box with "Sounds"
  when using HERETIC.

  NOTE about DOOM2/HERETIC support:
  - In the Edit Thing dialog box, only the Things from the doom version
	of the wad file are available, i.e. WinDEU won't display DOOM2 or
	HERETIC new enemies when using a DOOM1 main wad file.
  - Idem in the Edit Sector dialog box.


Feb 23 1995
-----------
- Added original deu key commands as accelerators in main menu.
- The WinDEU editor window is now disabled when building the nodes.
- Complete support of DOOM2 Things, Sectors, and LineDefs.
- Partial support of HERETIC Things(no pictures yet) and Sectors.

Feb 19 1995
-----------
- Context sensitive help for everything (using F1 key anytime)
- Help menu completed (search help on, using help, ...)
- Fast/slow scroll speed using SPACE key (and new menu item 
  Window|Slow Scroll)
- Map Scrolling using cursor keys

Feb 16 1995
-----------
- ScrollLock key is now working.
- Status bar is updated after saving a level
- Usage message box updated with new options
- Gamma correction and zoom level are kept in memory between dialog boxes

Feb 12-15 1995
--------------
- Changed the zip files name:
  W16DEU52.ZIP contains WinDEU 5.23, Windows (Win16) version
  W32DEU52.ZIP contains WinDEU 5.23, Windows NT (or Win32s) version
  WSCDEU52.ZIP contains the WinDEU 5.23 sources (unzip with -d).

- I updated the help file to explain all the WinDEU features.
  I included dialog boxes images with 'hotspots' explaining each
  part of the dialog boxes. (lot of work!)
  The next step is to implement contextual help.

Feb 9 1995
----------
- Broke the 64Kb barrier for the 'Dump Entry' and 'Master Directory' list
  boxes. There's still a limitations in the 'Dump Entry' list box: On my
  Windows version (WFG 3.11), only about 5000 strings are accepted in the
  list box, which corresponds to an entry of about 87.000 (0x0153E0) bytes.
  Hopefuly, such entries are not common (SideDefs of big levels).
  THERE'S NO WAY I CAN FIX THIS (except by changing the Windows Kernel ;)

Feb 6 1995
----------
- Better support of DOOM2 and HERETIC files. You can load a DOOM 1 (or
  HERETIC) patch wad when the main wad is the DOOM2 wad. If you load a E1M1
  patch wad, the level is added in the master directory and you can edit it
  using the new 'level number' dialog box.
  The things and LineDefs are now displayed with their real name (thanks to
  DEU 5.3 new W_THINGS.C and W_LINEDEFS.C files).

Feb 5 1995
----------
- **NEW FEATURE**
  The 'Edit|Dump Entry' menu item is now (at least) implemented. It doesn't
  work with big entries because of Windows limitations. It's not possible to
  output to a file.

- **NEW FEATURE**
  Changed the multi-tasking option. BuildPriority now defines the minimum
  number of milliseconds WinDEU will compute before giving control back to
  Windows. This setting has the advantage of being INDEPENDANT from the CPU
  speed. Legal settings are 0 to 1000. Good settings are 20 to 50.
  NOTE: - The overhead is still negligible.
	- A BuildPriority of 0 means no multi-tasking (like previous WinDEU
	  version)

- **NEW FEATURE**
  The preferences dialog allows to change almost every configuration options
  (not only default textures like before). You can even change to builder
  priority while your level is being rebuilt!

- The '64Kb' DEU bug fixed (read error when viewing pictures at the end of
  external PWADS).

Feb 4 1995
----------
- In 'Vertices' editing mode, the level redrawing is faster when the scale is
  small (currently smaller than 1/5). This speedup is obtained by reducing the
  details drawn (a point instead of a cross for a vertex, a line instead of a
  vector for a LineDef).

Feb 3 1995
----------
- **NEW FEATURE**
  WinDEU is now 'cooperative' when building the nodes of a level.
  There's a new configuration option ('BuildPriority' or 'bp') which lets you
  specify the priority of WinDEU (this priority determines approximately the
  frenquency at which WinDEU 'asks' Windows to give control back to other
  applications).
  WARNING: This is still a 'beta' features. The mouse is not desactivated in
	   the editor Window, so you can continue to edit your level while
	   it's being built!
	   If you move LineDefs and/or change the level, the Builder may
	   product unpredictable result. This feature was implemented for
	   people with slow processors who want to use other applications
	   when WinDEU is building the level.
  NOTE: - If you want WinDEU to work like before or if you use WinDEU32 under
	  Windows NT, set the 'BuildPriority' option to 0.
	- Don't be afraid to set a priority > 0. To test the overhead of
	  the cooperative 'multi-tasking', try to build a level with a
	  priority of 0, then with a priority of 100, without moving your
	  mouse or using other applications. You'll see the overhead is quite
	  negligible.
	  Currently, to rebuild the E2M7 level on my 486 DX50, it takes
	  84sec with priotity = 0 and 86sec with priority = 100 (with the
	  Win16 version of WinDEU!).

Feb 2 1995
----------
- GPF when trying to add a LineDef in a new level without vertexes.
  Bug fixed.

- Vertexes numbers were not taken in account when inserting a LineDef.
  The new LineDef simply had the same vertexes than current selected LineDef.
  Bug fixed.

- Bug when "Automerging Vertexes":
	Tim Morley sent me a mail to describe this bug (thanks to him!):

	"(...)In vertex mode if you try to insert a new vertex in the middle
	of an existing linedef, it asks you if you wish to split the
	line def, if you answer yes, it appears to do the job, however
	it doesn't quite do it right. You end up with a new vertex with
	s linedef to one of the end of the original line, and the
	original line in place.

	Let me draw a few pictures....

	start with

		X--------------------------X

	Place a new vertex in the middle of it, and it looks like this on
	screen

		X------------X-------------X

	Now if you move the new point round a bit you can see where
	things have gone wrong..

			X
		   /
		  /
		X--------------------------X
	(...)"
   Bug Fixed.

Jan 27 1995
-----------
-  I think this will be one of the last 5.23 version of WinDEU. WinDEU seems
   to be stable now. I'll soon begin to port DEU 5.3...

-  GPF when trying to start WinDEU without a valid DOOM.WAD file.
   Thanks to my brother for signaling the bug. Bug fixed.

Jan 20 1995
-----------
- New config option 'DrawLength' to enable the drawing of the length the
  moving LineDefs

Jan ?? 1995
-----------
- I've made an icon for WinDEU. Since I got no artist talent, if anyone
  has a better one to propose....

Jan 16 1995
-----------
- The CTL3DV2.DLL file is now included in the WINDEU.ZIP
  The CTL3D32.DLL file is now included in the WINDEU32.ZIP
  ** YOU MUST COPY THESE FILES IN YOUR WINDOWS' "SYSTEM" DIRECTORY
  ** AND REMOVE THEM FROM THE WINDEU DIRECTORY, OR IT WON'T WORK.
  ** For NT Users:
  **  The CTL3D32.DLL must be copied to the %SystemRoot%\system32 directory
  **  The CTL3DV2.DLL must be copied to the %SystemRoot%\system directory

- When editing SideDefs, it was impossible to set negative offsets, but
  the legal values are -255 to +255.
  Bug fixed.

Jan 12 1995
-----------
- Optimization of texture displaying. MUCH faster than before. The
  display is the fastest for 256 colors Windows Drivers, but is
  faster too for 32K, 64K and 16M colors Windows Drivers.

Jan 10 1995
-----------
- Each time you used the Right Mouse Buttons menus (in any editing mode),
  the Windows USER resources were eaten up by WinDEU. Bug fixed.
  Thanks to Drake O'Brien for signaling the bug.

- The mouse coord. are displayed with the 'grid' scale format: When
  use set the 'Snap to grid' option, the mouse coord. aren't continuous
  anymore, they are rounded to the nearest coord. which is on
  the grid.

Jan 7 1995
----------
- Level drawing is now -MUCH- faster when scale is 1/2, 1/1 or >1/1.
  Why? I use programmed scaling and clipping, instead of the windows
  ones. The drawing is NOT faster when WinDEU has to redraw the entire
  level (level totaly visible).

- Because of this faster drawing, the scroll bars are now
  'thumbtracked'. It means the map scrolls *real time* when you move
  the rect. button of the scroll bars.

- When the scale of the level editor is > 1, some circles appear
  randomly in the window (only under Windows, not NT). I think this
  is a bug in Windows (or in my video driver), because when run under
  NT, it's OK (both Win16 and Win32 versions). This bug is now fixed
  because WinDEU uses now program clipping, instead a Windows clipping.

- Minor fixes in the WinDEU help file.

Jan 6 1995
----------
- GPF when using command parameters. Bug in original DEU 5.21 code.
  Bug fixed.

- New option : '3DControls (3d)'. For those who don't like 3D controls, or
  don't have the CTL3Dxx.DLL, boolean to enable or disable the use
  of 3D controls.
  NOTE: For NT users, for WinDEU32 to work with 3D controls, the
	CTL3D32.DLL -MUST- be copied to the %SystemRoot%\system32
	directory (NOT to the %SystemRoot%\system directory).

- WinDEU didn't start if CTL3DV2.DLL not present.
  WinDEU32 didn't start if CTL3D32.DLL not present.
  (These DLLs are used for 3D Controls).
  Bug fixed.

- An invalid option (in command line or in the WINDEU.INI file) caused
  WinDEU to STOP on an error message. Now, the error message is
  still displayed, but WinDEU doesn't stop anymore.

- WinDEU stops if a sprite picture can't be found in the main wad
  file. Now WinDEU display an error message, but doesn't stop.

- WinDEU stops if an invalid patch wad file is opened. Now, WinDEU
  display an error message, but doesn't stop.

Jan 5 1995
----------
- GPF when trying to save a new created level (with Edit.Create Level
  menu item). Bug fixed. Thanks to Mark Bartusis for signaling the bug.

- Nodes creating (raphael's old code) caused GPFs for an empty level.
  GPFs occured when trying to build the nodes for a trivial level
  (I tried a level with only 1 Thing and 2 Vertices (no LineDef)).
  Bug fixed? (I tried).


======================================
Revision history before public release
======================================

Sep 09 94
---------

This version of WinDEU isn't still completly finished, but it's already
possible to create and/or edit any DOOM level (and the external WAD files).
Just like DEU, WinDEU has 4 edition modes:
	Things:   Decorations, weapons, ennemies, ...
	LineDefs: Lines and textures
	Vertexes: Points
	Sectors:  Sectors

The WinDEU editor works just like DEU's. Read the HELP file to find
the few differences in the user interface.


Oct 05 94
---------

. The 'level editor' part of WinDEU is now finished at 99%. Some bugs are
  still there (I think), but all menus and dialog boxes are working.

. The WAD file management part (main menu) is not finished. Some functions
  remains not implemented:
	List master
	Insert RAW object
	Extract object
	Save object
	Dump Entry


Dec 22 94
---------

. WinDEU is finished at 99%. The only missing function is 'Dump entry'.
  (I think this one is not very important).

. I have been in the DEU team for 3 weeks now, and the WinDEU version
  is 5.23beta, this will be the first public release.
